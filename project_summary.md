```python
def calculate_ehs(hand, board, opponent_range):
    """Research-based EHS calculation for poker"""
    current_hs = calculate_current_equity(hand, board, opponent_range)
    ppot = calculate_ppot(hand, board, opponent_range)  # Positive potential
    npot = calculate_npot(hand, board, opponent_range)  # Negative potential

    return (current_hs * (1 - npot)) + ((1 - current_hs) * ppot)
```

#### Monte Carlo Equity Simulation

```python
def calculate_poker_equity(player_hand, opponent_range, board):
    """High-precision equity calculation with opponent modeling"""
    # Adaptive simulation count based on available time
    simulation_count = min(base_simulations, max_simulations)

    for _ in range(simulation_count):
        # Deal random opponent hand from range
        opponent_hand = random.choice(opponent_range)

        # Simulate remaining community cards
        remaining_cards = deal_community_cards(board)

        # Evaluate both hands
        player_value = evaluate_hand(player_hand + remaining_cards)
        opponent_value = evaluate_hand(opponent_hand + remaining_cards)

        # Track results for equity calculation
